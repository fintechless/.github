# Support

Fintechless Platform contributors have limited availability to address general
support questions. When looking for support, please first search for your
question in these venues:

* [Open or closed issues in our GitHub organization](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+org%3Afintechless+is%3Aissue)

If you didn't find an answer in the resources above, try these unofficial
resources:

* [Questions tagged 'fintechless' on
Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/fintechless)
* [Fintechless Slack Community](https://fintechless.slack.com/)
  * To register: [nodeslackers.com](https://join.slack.com/t/fintechless/signup)

GitHub issues are for tracking enhancements and bugs, not general support.

The open source license grants you the freedom to use Fintechless Platform. It
does not guarantee commitments of other people's time. Please be respectful and
manage your expectations.
